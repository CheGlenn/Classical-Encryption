Classical-Encryption contains two programs, CaeserCipher encodes and decodes words using the Caeser Cipher method, and VigenereCipher which encodes and decodes words using the Vigenere Cipher method.

Resources:
Maria Rodriguez - Maria helped me to understand the math behind looping back to 0 when they addition of the base letter and key goes past 25. 

Update 10/3:
Updated VigenereCipher.java to include a 3rd method, keyCreator, that creates appropriate length keys for encryption. Also updated encryption and decryption math to accurately encrypt and decrypt. Fixed style.
